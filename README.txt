A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/flexmonster/pen/pQPKmJ.

 Flexmonster is a tool for online web reporting. It's a powerful component for analytics and data visualization.
This pen shows how NASA Astronauts dataset can be analyzed: you can use the Top X filter to find 10 astronauts with the highest number of space flights. Then you can expand the hierarchies in the rows to learn in which missions they participated. 
You can use report filters in the upper part of the pivot table to filter records by 'Alma Mater' field, 'Military Branch' field, 'Status' field, etc.
To drag & drop more fields on the grid, click on 'Fields' button to open the Field List. Here you can compose a new slice for your report. Save it or export to any format for sharing with your friends :) 

All the changes in the report are reflected in the charts . 
You can change the colors of the charts in their options.
This pivot table is integrated with Google Charts but you can integrate it with other charting libraries or use the embedded charts of Flexmonster.
